## API 
[Postman documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12628792/TVK75Ke8)
Some methods require an account. This can be created by the register method for now.

## Import

The pokemon data can be reset by running `php artisan pokemon:import`. See file `app/Console/Commands/ImportPokemon.php`.

## TODO 
### Must have
- [x] make a csv class to read the csv and make it into a collection.
- [x] create a Pokemon model, and the appropriate database migration
- [x] create an import command from the csv to the pokemons table
- [x] create the PokemonController, with postman documentation
### Should have
- [x] Heroku implementation
- [x] Do not allow create of the same name
- [x] create an autentication method for the API (use passport)
- [x] tidy code : put models in a Models/ directory
- [ ] remove register endpoint for even more security
- [ ] Commands, import : Bulk import instead of save in foreach
### Nice to have
- [ ] add a updated_by to the Pokemon class for more security
- [ ] soft delete
- [ ] Commands, import : make a separate command (or add option) that updates or create, and does not drop table pokemons
- [ ] Commands, import : allow to use another csv than /storage/app/csv/pokemon.csv
- [ ] Commands, import : make nice little user output
- [ ] Services, csv : make App\Services\CsvService take a path instead of writing and reading only in /storage/app/csv
